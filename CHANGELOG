martcal changelog
=================

Version 0.1.0 (25th June 2019)
------------------------------

Initial release

Martcal is a Python package for calculating the distance from any point
at sea to a port, accounting for land masses. The routing calculations
are based on a type of spherical trigonometry, where the system finds
the nearest port from sea using a mercator route, then solves for the
triangle.
