martcal
=======

Current release: 0.1.0


Description
-----------

Martcal is a Python package for calculating the distance from any point
at sea to a port, accounting for land masses. The method used
is based on spherical trigonometry, where the system will locate:
1. nearest port from sea using mercator distance 
2. distance from nearest port to destination port using static tables

The outcome will be the at-sea leg of resultant triangle.
