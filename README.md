=======

Current release: 0.1.0


Description
-----------

Martcal is a Python package for calculating the distance from any point
at sea to a port, accounting for land masses. The routing calculations
are based on a type of spherical trigonometry, where the system finds
the 1. nearest port from sea using a mercator distance and 2. distance from nearest port to destination port using distance tables. The outcome will be the solution of resultant triangle.
